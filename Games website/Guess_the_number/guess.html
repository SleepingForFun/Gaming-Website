<h5>How to Play</h5>
<h6>This is a game where you can guess the number. you can select from a rang of numbers. Either 1-10 to 1-100. You can enter your guess in the box where it says eter guess. Then all you have to do is press submit. You have to reclick on the selection each time before you guess. When ready press submit.</h6>

<h6>When you get it right it well tell you Congrats you got it right. But if your too high it will tell you that you guess too high. Samething if you guess too low. But make no mistake there are no second chances to guess the same number since it will display the number after.</h6>

<h6>After every attempt its recommended to press reset for the best results. reset it will make it brand new. Dont worry the score wont reset tho. So no matter how much times you win it will always be there. It goes on endless until refreshed.  </h6>
