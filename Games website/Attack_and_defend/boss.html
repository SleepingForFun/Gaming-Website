    <h3>How to Play</h3>
<h6>You and the boss both have 100 Hp each. The point of the game is to get the boss to 0 HP. You have 4 different actions you can choose from. The Attack button lets you deal either 6 or 7 damage to the boss. The defend lets you block partial damage from the boss. The Charge lets you charge up a Attack from 1 to 4 times multiplier with a chance to crit. Lastly the pot lets you drink a potion that either takes 30 of your health or gives you a 4x damage boost.</h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6>You can expect to beat the boss in one goal with just spamming attacks. If you do that you will just out right lose. There is a few ways to beat the boss and the one that I found most enjoyable is the one shot method. There are other methods but I made it so that this game relies more on luck than anything else so be warned.</h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6>How to One shot the boss. The first step is to drink the potion until you get the 4x multiplier or if not restart because you can only try 4 times before you die out. Note that if you drink the potion you dont take up a turn. Next you will keep charing until you get a crit. Once you meet both those condictions then all you have to do is press attack and enjoy your one shot.</h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6>Boss patterns. Theres not much to boss attack patterns. The boss will start the game off with an attack so its recommended to defend on the first turn. Then after that the boss will only attack after every 3 turns. But thats not all, the boss has a super attack every 10 turns that deal 30 heal damage instead of the normal 15.</h6>

<h6>Please give me feed back on what to add and what to improve on this was alot of fun to do compare to the others which I had done before and besides I can actually add on to this game and keep improving it.</h6>
