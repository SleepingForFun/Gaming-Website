<h3>How to Play</h3>
<h6> So far this is just your standard coinflip game. There is really nothing much to it. I plan to change this down the line but for now this will do. Really important if you click Flip and nothing happnes it means that it landed on the same side again. </h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6> This game is really simple all you have to do is click on flip and the game will work. Its better if you do this for a friend or you just need a coin flip app to help find the answers to your disguessions. But there is no animations or pictures. This is mainly due to me being bad at drawing. I spent 3 years as a CS Major so theres no way my drawing still will be any good.</h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6>down the Line I plan to add pictures to show the faces of the coin. But for now printing heads and tails will do. I plan to add my own drawing in the future even though I cant draw.</h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6>Honestly why are you still reading this. There is really nothing for me to explain about this game. This is basically filler text. I realized that I should of added more to this code but o well spent all my time on Black Jack.</h6>
